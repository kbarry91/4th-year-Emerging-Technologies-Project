# Emerging Technologies Project
## Motivation

This repository was developed as a project for the module Emerging Technologies as part of a Software Developement Degree in GMIT. The project involves writing documentation, code, and comments in the programming language Python [and using the Jupyter notebook software. The purpose of this project was to engage in new technologies and machine learning techniques.


## Introduction
The project contains 5 main folders. Folder 1,2,3,5 are Jupyter notebooks and folder 4 is Python script.
1. NumPy Random Notebook
2. Iris dataset notebook
3. MNIST dataset notebook
4. MNIST digit Recognition Script
5. MNIST Digit Recognition Notebook


## Prerequisities
In order to debug this Application you must have **Anaconda** installed. Anaconda is a popular Python data science platform
[How to install Anaconda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/windows.html) Make sure to add Anaconda to your system path.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## How to Run the Project 

### Downloading the project

#### Using the zip file
- Go to (https://github.com/kbarry91/Emerging-Technologies.git)
- Select *Download Zip*
- Extract the full folder in the target directory

#### Alternatively using GIT
- Ensure Git is installed https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Navigate to target directory of project in CMD
>Git clone https://github.com/kbarry91/Emerging-Technologies.git

### Install ther required libraries 
- navigate to the project directory
> $ conda install keras
> $ conda install numpy
> $ conda install scikit-learn
> $ conda install matplotlib 
> $ conda install opencv-python


### Run The Jupyter notebooks
- Navigate to the project directory and enter following command.
> $ jupyter notebook
- jupyter notebook will launch in the browser.
  
## Running the Python script
- Navigate to the script directory and enter following command.
> python digitrec.py  
- The program will run in the command window.



## Research 

In order to develope this application alot of effort went into research as UWP was a new platform to me. The microsoft docs available at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/ provided alot of insight as to how this app could be developed. Any code adapted from external sources has been clearly referenced through the code files.
